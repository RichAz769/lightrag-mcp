# API Alignment Checkpoint Protocol

## Purpose
Since I cannot remember to run tests between phases, we need an explicit protocol for tracking progress.

## Checkpoint Protocol

### Before Starting Any Phase
1. **I will explicitly ask you to run the tracker**
2. **You run the command and share results**
3. **I analyze results and proceed with fixes**

### After Completing Any Phase
1. **I will explicitly ask you to run the tracker again**
2. **You run the command and share results**
3. **We analyze progress together**
4. **Decide on next steps based on results**

## Commands to Run

### Baseline (Before any fixes)
```bash
python3 api_alignment_tracker.py baseline
```

### After Phase 1 (HTTP Client Fixes)
```bash
python3 api_alignment_tracker.py phase1
```

### After Phase 2 (Request Parameter Fixes)
```bash
python3 api_alignment_tracker.py phase2
```

### After Phase 3 (Response Model Fixes)
```bash
python3 api_alignment_tracker.py phase3
```

## My Responsibilities
- ✅ Explicitly request testing at each checkpoint
- ✅ Wait for your results before proceeding
- ✅ Analyze results and plan next steps
- ✅ Implement fixes systematically

## Your Responsibilities
- ✅ Run the tracker when I request it
- ✅ Share the output with me
- ✅ Confirm when you're ready to proceed

## Example Checkpoint Conversation

**Me:** "Before we start Phase 1, let's establish our baseline. Please run: `python3 api_alignment_tracker.py baseline` and share the results."

**You:** [Share results showing 2/22 tools working]

**Me:** "Perfect! I can see we're starting at 9% success rate. Now I'll implement the HTTP client fixes for Phase 1..."

[I implement fixes]

**Me:** "Phase 1 fixes are complete. Please run: `python3 api_alignment_tracker.py phase1` to measure our progress."

**You:** [Share results showing 7/22 tools working]

**Me:** "Excellent! We improved from 9% to 32% success rate. Ready for Phase 2..."

## Fail-Safe Reminders
If I forget to ask for testing, you can remind me by saying:
- "Should we run the tracker to check progress?"
- "Let's test the current status"
- "Time for a checkpoint?"

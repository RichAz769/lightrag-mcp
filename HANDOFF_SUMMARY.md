# MCP Server Debug Handoff Summary

## Current Problem
The daniel-lightrag MCP server is failing to connect with this specific error:

```
Failed to connect to MCP server "daniel-lightrag": MCP error 0: 2 validation errors for ListToolsResult
tools.0: Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of Tool [type=model_type, input_value=('nextCursor', None), input_type=tuple]
tools.1: Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of Tool [type=model_type, input_value=('tools', [Tool(name='ins...: {}, 'required': []})]), input_type=tuple]
```

## What Happened
1. **Original Issue**: MCP server was working fine, but had validation errors for 5 specific tools due to response schema mismatches between RAG server responses and MCP model expectations.

2. **My Changes**: I fixed the Pydantic models in `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/models.py` to align with actual RAG server responses:
   - Made `query` field optional in `QueryResponse`
   - Removed non-existent `status` fields from `PipelineStatusResponse` and `TrackStatusResponse`
   - Removed non-existent `cleared`/`count` fields from `ClearDocumentsResponse` and `ClearCacheResponse`
   - Fixed `LabelsResponse` handling in client

3. **New Problem**: After my changes, the MCP server can no longer connect at all. The `ListToolsResult` creation is failing with tuple validation errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error shows that `ListToolsResult` is receiving tuples `('nextCursor', None)` and `('tools', [Tool(...)])` instead of proper arguments. This suggests:

1. **Version Mismatch**: The MCP library version may have changed how `ListToolsResult` constructor works
2. **Import Issue**: Something wrong with how `ListToolsResult` is imported or used
3. **Serialization Problem**: The MCP framework is somehow converting the arguments to tuples during transmission

## Debug Evidence
From the logs, I can see:
- Tools are created correctly as `<class 'mcp.types.Tool'>` objects
- The server logs show "ListToolsResult created successfully with 22 tools"
- But then Kiro receives tuples instead of the expected structure

## Current State
- **Working**: The direct client library works 100% (18/18 tools pass comprehensive test)
- **Broken**: MCP server connection fails at the `ListToolsResult` creation step
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/models.py` (response model fixes)
  - `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/client.py` (LabelsResponse handling)
  - `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (fixed command path)

## What Needs to Be Done
1. **Immediate**: Fix the `ListToolsResult` creation issue to restore MCP server connectivity
2. **Then**: Verify that the original model fixes work once connection is restored
3. **Test**: Ensure all 22 MCP tools work without validation errors

## Files to Focus On
- `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/server.py` - The `handle_list_tools()` function around line 518
- `archive/testing_scripts/working_server.py` - Reference for working ListToolsResult creation
- MCP library version/imports - May need to check compatibility

## Key Insight
The issue is NOT with the tools themselves (they're valid Tool objects) but with how the `ListToolsResult` is being constructed or serialized. The MCP framework is somehow receiving tuples where it expects Tool objects.

# Handoff Prompt for New Session

I need help debugging a critical MCP server connection issue. Here's the situation:

**Problem**: My daniel-lightrag MCP server was working fine, but after I made some Pydantic model fixes to resolve validation errors, the MCP server can no longer connect. It's failing with this error:

```
Failed to connect to MCP server "daniel-lightrag": MCP error 0: 2 validation errors for ListToolsResult
tools.0: Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of Tool [type=model_type, input_value=('nextCursor', None), input_type=tuple]
tools.1: Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of Tool [type=model_type, input_value=('tools', [Tool(name='ins...: {}, 'required': []})]), input_type=tuple]
```

**Key Facts**:
1. The server logs show tools are created correctly as `mcp.types.Tool` objects
2. The server logs show "ListToolsResult created successfully with 22 tools"
3. But Kiro receives tuples instead of Tool objects in the ListToolsResult
4. This suggests a version mismatch or serialization issue with the MCP library

**What I Need**:
- Fix the `ListToolsResult` creation in `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/server.py` around line 518
- The `handle_list_tools()` function is failing when it tries to return `ListToolsResult(tools=tools)`
- There's a working reference in `archive/testing_scripts/working_server.py`

**Files to examine**:
- `src/daniel_lightrag_mcp/server.py` (the broken server)
- `archive/testing_scripts/working_server.py` (working reference)
- `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md` (full context)

Please focus ONLY on fixing the ListToolsResult creation issue to restore MCP connectivity. Don't get distracted by the original validation errors - those can be addressed once the server connects again.

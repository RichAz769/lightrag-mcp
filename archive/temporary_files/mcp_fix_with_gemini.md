Great news - **yes, that worked\!** The logs confirm that the server is now connecting successfully.

### Your Log Analysis

Here‚Äôs the proof in your logs:

1.  **The Error is Gone:** In your previous logs, right after the tools were created, you'd get the red `[error]` message: `MCP error 0: 1 validation error for ListToolsResult`. That error is now completely gone.
2.  **The Success Message:** The sequence now ends with this key line:
    ```
    [info] [daniel-lightrag] Successfully connected to MCP server
    ```
    This confirms that the entire initialization process, which includes fetching the tool list, completed without any issues. ‚úÖ

### Summary of the Fix

Just to recap, the problem was never in your code that defined the tools. The issue was a bug in the external **`mcp` library**. Its `@server.list_tools()` decorator was incorrectly handling the data your function was returning.

By changing your function to return a simple `list` of tools, we gave the decorator the exact data type it was expecting, which successfully bypassed the bug.

### Recommended Follow-Up

Your server is working, which is the main goal. However, the underlying bug still exists in the `mcp` library.

As a good practice, you should consider **reporting this bug** to the developers of the `mcp` library. You can usually do this by creating an "Issue" on their GitHub or GitLab page.

When you report it, you can briefly explain:

  * The Pydantic validation errors you were seeing.
  * The version of the `mcp` library you are using.
  * The workaround that solved it (having the function return a `List[Tool]` directly instead of a `ListToolsResult` object).

This will help the library maintainers fix the bug for everyone in a future update. For now, you can confidently move forward with the working code you have.

Well done on debugging this\! üëç
